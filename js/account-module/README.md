# Sample code for the account module in JavaScript

This repository contains the sample code that we use on the [IOTA documentation portal](https://docs.iota.org/docs/client-libraries/0.1/account-module/js/get-started) to help you get started with the JavaScript account module.

## Prerequisites

To get started you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your device.

If you don't have a JavaScript development environment or if this is your first time using the JavaScript client library, complete our [getting started guide](https://docs.iota.org/docs/client-libraries/0.1/getting-started/js-quickstart).

## Getting started

To start playing with these examples run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JakeSCahill/iota-samples.git
cd iota-samples/js/account-module
npm i
node create-account/create-account.js
```

You should see the balance of your new account.

You'll also have a directory that keeps track of your seed state.
